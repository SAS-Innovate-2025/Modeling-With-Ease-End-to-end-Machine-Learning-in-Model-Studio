# Modeling With Ease: End-to-end Machine Learning in Model Studio

Effective predictive modeling projects follow the SAS®  Analytics Life Cycle, from Data to Discovery and then Deployment. The SAS®  Viya platform provides the capability to perform all these steps from one graphical user interface, making the transition between stages of the analytics life cycle seamless.
In this hands-on workshop, you load data into memory, prepare input variables for modeling, and build complex analytics pipelines to demonstrate powerful machine learning models. Need to better understand your model? No problem. We'll show you how to produce model interpretability plots. Need to integrate open-source models? No problem. We’ll show you how to do that and deploy any model with one click. Then the best-performing model is saved and packaged for deployment, and you still have the ability to retrain this model on new data--all from the same shared interface.
